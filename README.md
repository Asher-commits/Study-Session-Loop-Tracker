# Study-Session-Loop-Tracker

GOAL:
Build a small page where the user can:
1) Type how many study sessions they did today.
2) Type how many minutes each session lasted.
3) Click a button.
4) See a multi-line summary generated by a LOOP that:
    - repeats for each session,
    - calculates total minutes,
    - and gives feedback using conditionals.
